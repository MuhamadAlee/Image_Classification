# vehicle Classification

In this Project we try to classify the vehicles (Bikes, Cycles and cars) using convolution neural Network (CNN).

step 1 : Firstly we have gathered the images of all the vehicles mentioned above of different styles.

step 2 : then we have placed these images as the input to the CNN model for training purpose.

step 3 : After the training we have performed testing on some of the imgaes using CNN prepared model.

Step 4 : Then we have stored this model for later on usage.

step 5 : At last we have developed an interactive Web application using Flask web framework of python for this.
